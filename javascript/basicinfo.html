    <!-- how to include javascript
    
    There are generally main three ways to include javascript

        1)Embedding code
        2)Inline code
        3)External file


        1)Embedding code:-
            To add the JavaScript code into the HTML pages, we can use the <script>.....</script> tag of the HTML that wrap around JavaScript code inside the HTML program. Users can also define JavaScript code in the <body> tag (or we can say body section) or <head> tag because it completely depends on the structure of the web page that the users use.

        2) Inline Code:-
            Generally, this method is used when we have to call a function in the HTML event attributes. There are many cases (or events) in which we have to add JavaScript code directly eg., OnMover event, OnClick, etc.
        
        3) External File;-

    <!-- There are 4 ways to declare the variable
    
        using var
        using let
        using const
        using nothing


        var keyword is a used to define the variable as a global scope

        let keyword is used to define the variable as a local scope

        const keyword is used for the particular constant value that we can not change that value further.

        in const keyword we cannot reassigned value.

        Use const when you declare:

            A new Array
            A new Object
            A new Function
            A new RegExp

            The keyword const is a little misleading.

                It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

                Because of this you can NOT:

                    Reassign a constant value
                    Reassign a constant array
                    Reassign a constant object

                    But you CAN:
                    Change the elements of constant array
                    Change the properties of constant object

            Constant Arrays

            You can change the elements of a constant array:

            / You can create a constant array:
                const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

                // You can change an element:
                cars[0] = "Toyota";

                // You can add an element:
                cars.push("Audi");

                But you can NOT reassign the array:

                 const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

                cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR 


                Constant Objects

                You can change the properties of a constant object:

                // You can create a const object:
                const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

                // You can change a property:
                car.color = "red";

                // You can add a property:
                car.owner = "Johnson"; 
                    

                But you can NOT reassign the object:

                 const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

                car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"};    // ERROR 

                Block Scope

                    Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.

                    The x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared outside the block:

                    Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:

                    var x = 2;     // Allowed
                    const x = 2;   // Not allowed

                    {
                    let x = 2;     // Allowed
                    const x = 2;   // Not allowed
                    }

                    {
                    const x = 2;   // Allowed
                    const x = 2;   // Not allowed


                    Reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed:

                    const x = 2;     // Allowed
                    x = 2;           // Not allowed
                    var x = 2;       // Not allowed
                    let x = 2;       // Not allowed
                    const x = 2;     // Not allowed

                    {
                    const x = 2;   // Allowed
                    x = 2;         // Not allowed
                    var x = 2;     // Not allowed
                    let x = 2;     // Not allowed
                    const x = 2;   // Not allowed

                    Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:


                    const x = 2;       // Allowed

                    {
                    const x = 3;   // Allowed
                    }

                    {
                    const x = 4;   // Allowed
                    } 
}
}
